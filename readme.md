## Project Overview

This repository contains a configurable PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and timer module, along with a comprehensive testbench for simulation and verification. The design supports multiple PWM channels, Wishbone bus interfacing, external clock and duty cycle inputs, and various control features for flexible operation.  

You can simulate the design using ModelSim or any compatible Verilog simulator.
